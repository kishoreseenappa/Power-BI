ðŸ“Š Sales Analysis Dashboard â€“ Power BI Project
Welcome to my Sales Analytics Dashboard project, built using Power BI. This project aims to demonstrate my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights that can help business stakeholders make data-informed decisions.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
This dashboard provides a detailed analysis of sales performance across products, regions, and sales teams. It helps answer key business questions like:

Which product categories are driving the most revenue?

How are different regions performing over time?

Who are the top-performing salespeople?

Are we improving year-over-year?
